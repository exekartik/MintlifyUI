# Mintlify Documentation Website (HTML & CSS)

This project is a desktop-first recreation of the Mintlify documentation website.
It was built as part of the Web Dev Cohort 2026 HTML & CSS assignment.

The goal of this project was to match the structure, layout, typography, and
overall visual appearance of the original website as closely as possible using
only HTML and CSS.


## Sections Recreated

The following sections were implemented:

- Top navigation bar with logo, links, and CTAs  
- Hero section with headline, description, email input, and illustration  
- Trusted by / company logos section  
- Feature highlight cards and intelligence section  
- Enterprise features and customer story section  
- Customer stories carousel (static, no JS)  
- Final call-to-action section  
- Footer with multi-column links, security badge, and theme icons  

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (no frameworks, no Tailwind)  
- Google Fonts (Geist Mono)  
- Custom CSS variables for colors and spacing  

---

## Fonts & Colors

**Fonts**
- Inter (primary UI font)
- Geist Mono (used for label text)

**Colors**
- Background: white / light gray tones
- Primary text: near-black
- Accent color: green (Mintlify-style)
- Borders: subtle gray tones

All colors are defined using CSS variables for consistency.

## Notes

- This project is desktop-only as required by the assignment.
- No JavaScript or animations were used.
- Layout accuracy and visual similarity were prioritized over responsiveness.
- Images and icons are similar to the original Mintlify website.
- The navigation bar does not change style on scroll, as this behavior requires JavaScript, which was not allowed for this assignment.
